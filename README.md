## The Botanical Autonomy Mod!

I love Botania and find I want to do things from other mods with just Botania so 
I'm adding in bits and pieces here.  Most of these features will require the even 
resources so will be mid to late game Botania additions.

## Current Features

* Dreamwood Avatar - upgraded avatar that can interact with the world. Think of 
    a more mystical, mana oriented autonomous activator.
* Rod of Will - Rod that the dreamworld avatar can use to right click blocks
* Rod of Toil - Rod that the dreamworld avatar can use combined with tools to right click blocks.
* Can use axes, pickaxes, hoe ... to break blocks.
* Changes this version 0.3.0 from Botaunomy

	No nibbler library dependency
	Animated secuence when breaking blocks.
	Avatar can break blocks.


## Future Features

* Use tools with entities.
